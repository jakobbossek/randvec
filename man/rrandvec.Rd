\title{Generate random vectors that sum up to one.}
\usage{
rrandvec(n, d, method = "normalization", shuffle = FALSE, as.df = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
Number of vectors to generate.}

\item{d}{[\code{integer(1)}]\cr
Number of components of each vector (at least 2).}

\item{method}{[\code{character(1)}]\cr
One of \dQuote{norm} (normalization method), \dQuote{trigonometric},
\dQuote{simplex} (sample from a unit simplex), \dQuote{exponential}
or \dQuote{iterative}.
Default is \code{simplex}.}

\item{shuffle}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Should the values of each vector be permutatet randomly?
Background: methods \dQuote{iterative} and \dQuote{trigonometric} introduce
unwanted bias (see desciption). This issue can be alliviated by random
shuffling.
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{as.df}{[\code{logical(1)}]\cr
Should the return value be a data frame with column names X1 to Xd?
Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
[\code{matrix(n, d)}] \eqn{(n \times d)} matrix even if \eqn{n=1}.
}
\description{
Generate an \eqn{n \times d} matrix. Each row vector is a
probability vector \eqn{(p_1, \ldots, p_d)} with \eqn{\sum_{i=1}^{d} p_i = 1}.
The function offers several methods to generate the rows in a way that the
components are unbiased which means that they are required to have similar /
the same probability distributions.
